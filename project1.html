            <h2>Challenge</h2>

            <p>Museums are growingly using digital technologies to improve the visitor experience.
                Museum curators spend a lot of time thinking about how to present information to visitors through signs,
                guides and various types of interactive exhibits.
                However, there are less occasions where visitors are able to contribute information for the museum.</p>

            <h3>Aims</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Design an interactive digital technology to improve the experience of visitors for the Design Museum
                    based upon user research</li>
                <li>The technology should let visitors contribute some form of content, leaving a “trace” of their visit
                </li>
                <li>The technology should be delivered as a prototype which should undergo an evaluation testing</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>User research</h2>

                <h3>Observations</h3>

                <p>I chose an individual visiting the museum and followed them through their visit. Recorded how they
                    interacted with the museum and made inferences.
                    I chose to come on different days and times to see how the experience changes.
                    The observations really helped identify the nuances in people’s behaviour</p>

                <img src="/img/design_quiz/design_museum.png" alt="Photograph of the Design Museum's interior">

                <h3>Interviews</h3>

                <p>I interviewed three people who
                    were at the end of their visit for
                    the Design Museum.
                    I asked open ended questions to
                    find more about their
                    experiences and why they came
                    to the museum. The
                    interviewees did not elaborate
                    on their answers, so I had to ask
                    follow up questions to get more
                    complex answers.
                    To improve upon next time,
                    I think I would ask visitors at the
                    beginning of their visit to find
                    out what they are expecting
                    to see at the museum.</p>

                        <td>Wanted more details on exhibits, felt that his knowledge often exceeded what was on offer.

                        <td>He felt like the museum was quite short overall and would have enjoyed it more if there were

                            them if there was one that was geared towards adults.</td>
                        <td>He interacted with the screens at random and could not mention any interaction that stood
                            out.</td>

            <h2>Define</h2>

            <h3>Persona</h3>

            <p>Using the user research found in the observations and interviews, a primary and secondary
                persona was created. As a group we categorised similiar traits and experiences and fed these
                details into the personas. There was continous refinement of the goals and frustrations as the product
                developed.

                I created the personas using Adobe Illustrator. The designs were simple and easy to
                empathise during the ideation process.

                Jack Shingher was the primary
                persona shown below.</p>

            <h3>User Journeys</h3>

            <p>We created user journeys for each of the personas. The user journey was mapped as the the route they
                would take through the Design Museum.
                It was decided to split them into 3 main phases of their visits: arriving at the museum; exploring the
                exhbits; leaving the museum.
                At each stage the emotions of the personas are highlighted by emoji icons and are provided with both
                their motivations and frustrations.</p>

                <h2>Ideation</h2>

                <h3>Initial Sketches</h3>

                <p>As a team an ideation workshop was held where we went through several ideation techniques such as:
                    constraint removal, worst possible ideas and brain writing. We made sure we did not critique the
                    designs at this early stage. The point of the
                    session was to generate as many alternative designs as possible.

                    Then the designs were categorised into groups of similar ideas. Each group member was the given the
                    task to explore a group for further ideation.

                    Sketching is an important skill as it
                    allows to quickly to generate ideas
                    but also not to feel attached to it.</p>

                    alt="Varied sketches during initial ideation session">

                <h3>Developing ideas</h3>

                <p>Firstly, we explored by looking at the various ways the visitors can answer the questions.
                    There were two ways that stood out which was either building a controller to answer questions or
                    using balls on the stairs travelling in tunnels
                </p>

                <div class="idea1">

                    <img class="idea1a" src="/img/design_quiz/Idea1a@4x-100.jpg" alt="Idea 1a">

                    <img src="/img/design_quiz/Idea1b@4x-100.jpg" alt="Idea 1b">

                </div>

                <p>We liked the idea of building a controller as the user will have sense of creating something while
                    they are in the museum.
                    However we wanted to remove the process of building it in a station and would prefer to create it
                    near the stairs.</p>

                <img src="/img/design_quiz/Idea2@4x-100.jpg" alt="Idea 2">

                <p>
                    Then we looked into developing ways of the visitors inputting questions. One idea was to use voice
                    input near the exhbits to provide their questions. Another idea was to use touch screens at the top
                    of the stairs.
                    We decided to use a touch screen interface that has voice input capabilities. Through user research
                    we found some visitors may not want to use just voice for inputting their questions and would need
                    to provide an
                    alternative input method.
                </p>

        </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section5">


        <h2>Final designs</h2>

        <p>The final design consisted of having question input stations dotted around the exhbits in the museum. This
            allows users to create questions based on the the knowledge they have
            just aquired or from past
            experiences.</p>

        <img src="/img/design_quiz/Artboard 1 copy 6@4x-100.jpg" alt="Final design 1">

        <p>The quiz game will be based on the stairs of the Design Museum. Visitors will construct their quiz
            controllers using 3D objects on their retractable tables.
            The objects will be found underneath them in a bunker.</p>

        <p>Questions are answered by touching the objects corresponding to the letter of the answer. The technology is
            based on 'Makey Makey'. As
            visitors answer questions
            consecutively, the combo meter increases. If wrong, the combo meter is reset.</p>
