            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>An investigation if providing energy visualisations can help people reduce household energy usage.
                Three types of visualisation designs
                were identified for energy usage which was Dashboard, Ambience and Eco-Visualisations.
                Prototypes were developed based on each type that could help residents understand their
                energy usage better and help make changes for their behaviour. A qualitative study found that
                residents are willing to have energy visualisations, but they all have different reasons for
                using it. Hence it is important that residents are given a choice on what type of information
                they want to see in their visualisations.
            </p>

            <h3>Research questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How can future energy consumption data be represented?</li>
                <li>Are these designs something consumers want in their household?</li>
                <li>Could these visualisations try to promote behavioural change?</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>Sketches</h3>

                <p>The thickness of ice will vary depending on how people use their energy. Good decisions in how energy
                    usage is managed will be reflected in the thickness of ice increasing. This will provide people with
                    a connectioon in how their decisions with environments far away.</p>

                <p>Birds eye view of a desert type environment. Similarily to the previous sketch, the environement will either be thriving or going through desertification depending on the decisions people make around their energy usage in their household. These designs could be shown on a mobile screen as a widget or on a dashboard screen.</p>
